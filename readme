Kaggle Competitions
________________________

This repository contains code used to compete in Kaggle competitions from 2015 onwards.
The competitions are based mostly on commercial briefs although some are purely for fun (March Machine Learning Mania is a basketball game prediction challenge)

The final ranking obtained in the competitions can be seen here:

The Code
____________

The code is written mostly in Python (there are some R scripts too) and makes heavy use of the Scikit Learn libraries.
The more recent projects use a standardised directory structure

> code
> input
> output

Where the input directory contains the very large source data files usually in csv, h5 or json file format. This data is not replicated here.
The output directory usually contains a number of csv files which are the individual submissions to the competition. These csv files are ignored in the github repository.
